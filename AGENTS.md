This file provides guidance for working with code in this repository,
for use by coding assistants.

## Repository Overview

**Sippy (CIPI â€“ Continuous Integration Private Investigator)** is a tool
used within the OpenShift engineering organization to analyze CI job
results. Its primary goals are to:

* Provide insights into job and test statistics.
* Monitor release health and detect regressions.
* Support release management decisions through statistical analysis (e.g., Component Readiness).

The system consists of:

* A **Go-based API backend**.
* A **React/Material-UI frontend** (located in `sippy-ng`).
* Data sources including **PostgreSQL**, and **BigQuery**

## Backend Guidelines

* Written in **Golang**.
* When adding or updating APIs, **use HATEOAS** in responses to support discoverability and consistent client interaction.
* Follow idiomatic Go practices.

## Frontend Guidelines

* The frontend code lives entirely under the `sippy-ng` directory.
* After making changes, always run formatting and linting to maintain consistency:

```bash
npx eslint . --fix
npx prettier --write .
```

* Prefer functional components and React hooks over class components.
* Keep UI elements consistent with Material-UI standards.

## General Notes

* Favor clarity and maintainability over cleverness.
* Comments should be helpful and explain non-obvious details. Explain why not what.
