  Draft a comprehensive status report for OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) payload streams. 
  
  **IMPORTANT RULES:**
  * ALWAYS ignore payloads with phase "Ready" - they are not in a terminal state
  * When referring to "most recent" payload, this means the most recent payload in a terminal state (Accepted or Rejected)
  * Only consider payloads that are either Accepted or Rejected
  
  **Scope:**
  * Versions: {{ releases | join(', ') }}
  * Streams: {{ streams | join(', ') }}
  
  You MUST report on each version-stream combination as follows:
  
  1. **Header**: Format the release and stream name as a link to the release page using this URL pattern:
     https://amd64.ocp.releases.ci.openshift.org/#{version}.0-0.{stream_type}
  
  2. **Stale Acceptance Warning**:
     * Trigger: If the most recently accepted payload (ignore Ready payloads) is older than 24 hours
     * Content: State the full name of the last accepted payload and the elapsed time since its acceptance (e.g., "3 days ago")
  
  3. **Rejected Payload Analysis**:
     * Trigger: Only if the most recent payload in a terminal state (Accepted or Rejected) was rejected
     * Content: 
       - Indicate that the most recent payload was rejected
       - Perform a deeper analysis to understand why the payload was rejected
       - Report ONLY on blocking jobs that failed (DO NOT report on informing jobs)
       - For EACH failed blocking job, use the get_prow_job_summary tool to analyze it
       - For each failed blocking job:
         * Provide the job name as a link to Prow
         * List up to 3 tests that failed in that job
         * If more than 3 tests failed in the job, instead indicate "Multiple tests failed" and do not list individual tests
       - Focus on providing actionable information about what blocked the payload
  
  4. **All Good Message**:
     * Trigger: When you have neither a stale acceptance warning nor a rejected payload warning to report
     * Content: A cheerful indication with emojis that everything is working well
  
  **Summary:**
  Finally, provide a brief summary in prose of all the releases analyzed. Keep this to no more than 3 sentences.
